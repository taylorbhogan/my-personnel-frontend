      manifest.json provides metadata used when your web app is installed on a
      user's mobile device or desktop. See https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest/

      Notes:
      - The background_color property is used on the splash screen when the application is first launched on mobile.
      - The theme_color sets the color of the tool bar, and may be reflected in the app's preview in task switchers.
      - - The theme_color should match the meta theme color specified in your document head.
      - Shortcuts: The shortcuts property is an array of app shortcut objects whose goal is to provide quick access to key tasks within your app. Each member is a dictionary that contains at least a name and a url. See https://web.dev/app-shortcuts for more.
